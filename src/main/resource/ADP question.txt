priorityqueue - peek and poll : The peek() method only retrieved the element at the head but 
the poll() also removes the element along with the retrieval. A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority.
 It is known that a queue follows First-In-First-Out algorithm
welcome to app .o/p : app to welcome 
3)count the last word of string : 
hi i am 5000 ajay . output : ajay length is 4 
5) comparator predefiend method , public int compare(T o1, T o2);
6)type_forward_only type in jdbc . ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY -The cursor can only move forward in the result set.
	ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE -he cursor can scroll forward and backward, and the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result set was created
	ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE.- The cursor can scroll forward and backward, and the result set is sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result set was created
7) JDBC using which design pattern  : Bridge Design, Static factory method ,Transactional pattern ,Proxy 
8) oops main principle : encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism, abstraction 
9) serialzable class example 
10) transient keyword while saving object in file : it will not store transient value in file , it will store default value while doing serialization
11) hashset internal using which data structure : ds is HAshtable that is HAshMAp instance 
12) volatile key word use : yet another way to make class as thread safe like synchronized
13) interface contain which method : abstract method 
14) getsession() method present in which class  : HTTPSession 
15) WeekHashmap example 
16) private boolean enable ; write accessor method for this 2 
Ans ;public boolean isEnable() {
		return enable;
	}

	public void setEnable(boolean enable) {
		this.enable = enable;
	}

public class HashMapExp {
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		WeakHashMap<String, String> wh = new WeakHashMap<String, String>();
		String key = new String();
		wh.put(key, "hi");
		key = null;
		System.gc();
		System.out.println(wh.get(key));//  output : null

	}

17) servlet artifact while deploying to servlet container . what is the artifact 
18) type safe question : generic are type safe
19) hashtable hashmap and cocurrenthashmap difference
20) stringbuffer builder and string diff : StringBuilder : not thread safe ,StringBuffer : synchronized thread safe , String - immutable so therad safe
